	<h3>Below are the instructions on how this webpage works:</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center">You must allow the use of the camera for this app to work. The screen will show your webcam, as well as the prediction for what the student is doing, and a number showing how sure the prediction is. Keep this tab open for as long as you would like to see the predictions, and once you are done, you can stop the predictions by closing the tab. If needed, refresh the page to restart the program. The buttons above will allow you to go to the home page and the demo page.</p>
